#   Offsets are measured from the centre of your coil, to the tip of your nozzle 
#   on a level axis. It is vital that this is accurate. 
x_offset: 0                          
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
y_offset: 15                     
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
#backlash_comp: 0.5
#   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
#   the sensor response.
#sensor: cartographer
#    this must be set as cartographer unless using IDM etc.
#sensor_alt: carto
#    alternate name to call commands. CARTO_TOUCH etc      

#    Number of passes to make during mesh scan.
